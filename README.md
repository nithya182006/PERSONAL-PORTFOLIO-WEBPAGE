I created my personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and professional layout. I began by structuring the content with semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> to ensure readability and maintainability. Then, I used CSS to design a visually appealing interface with a modern and official-looking blue theme, responsive layout, and custom fonts from Google Fonts. I applied styling features like gradients, box shadows, and hover effects to enhance the user experience. The site includes sections for an introduction, project highlights, and contact details, providing a clear and organized view of my work. This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and taught me how to build user-friendly, responsive web interfaces from scratch.
